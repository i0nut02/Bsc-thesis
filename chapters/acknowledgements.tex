\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

What started as an unexpected detour has now led me to this final chapter of my bachelor’s degree. It’s been a challenging journey, full of surprises, but I’m finally here.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, who always made himself available, and to my co-advisor for introducing me to this project.

I am profoundly grateful to my parents for their unwavering support, belief in my potential, and their sacrifices throughout this path, allowing me to pursue my own way and follow my aspirations.

To my university classmates, with whom I spent most of these years, thank you for the countless hours we shared, helping me grow not just technically but, more importantly, as a person.

To my closest friends, who have been there since kindergarten and middle school, thank you for being a source of comfort and for helping me take breaks from university life. Your support has meant the world to me.

Finally, I want to thank everyone who has helped me grow. Your support has made all the difference.
